    ],
    "content": "An academic work is duly recognized only if it demonstrates integrity and responsible behaviour. Honesty is the cornerstone of all academic activities. Consequently, academic endeavours at IIIT Una are expected to be fundamentally rooted in this principle. Regardless of any adverse situations or constraints, IIIT Una expects its students to adhere to a path of honesty and academic integrity to achieve their goals. The challenge in academic writing lies in building upon the work of others to create something original. Acknowledging the use of others' ideas, phrases, and words is essential not only for maintaining academic integrity but also for upholding the high standards of the Institute. This practice demonstrates respect for the original creators, ensures transparency in the scholarly work, and fosters a culture of honesty and accountability.\n\nPlagiarism is the use, without acknowledgement, of the intellectual work of other people, and the act of representing the ideas or discoveries of another as one's own in written work submitted for assessment. To copy sentences, phrases or even striking expressions without acknowledgement of the source (either by inadequate citation or failure to indicate verbatim quotations), is plagiarism; to paraphrase without acknowledgement is likewise plagiarism. Where such copying or paraphrase has occurred the mere mention of the source in the bibliography shall not be deemed sufficient acknowledgement; each such instance must be referred specifically to its source. Verbatim quotations must be either in inverted commas, or indented, and directly acknowledged. All sources, whether written or electronic, must be properly acknowledged using an approved format. Failure to do so constitutes academic misconduct. There are the procedures that are followed when a member of faculty/examiner suspects that a student has submitted a piece of work for assessment that contains plagiarised material. The procedures are the same for both Master's and Doctoral cases.\n\n3.1.1. All work submitted by students for assessment must be the student's own work.",

It is an offence for any student to be guilty of, or party to, plagiarism, the fabrication of research results, or any other act which may mislead the examiners about the development and authorship of work presented in assessments, including misleading examiners about the source of information included in an assessment.\n3.1.3. All work must fully acknowledge, in an approved format, all sources of information used in preparing the work being submitted. This includes acknowledging all written and electronic sources.\n3.1.4. The development of academic skills is an important part of student learning. It is recognized that students new to higher education may be inexperienced, and may need time to develop good academic referencing skills. For this reason, to benefit the students a separate document will be prepared to educate them about the plagiarism.\n\nThe Institute assessment procedures are designed to enable the identification of plagiarism, and the Institute may make use of electronic means in reviewing student work. Where there is evidence indicating that there may be a case of plagiarism the assessment is referred to an Investigating Officer who will investigate the case in detail. An investigating officer is appointed for a period of two years by the competent authority. Investigating Officers may also act as Misconduct Panel members in cases where they have not determined the prima facie case.\n\nAcademic misconduct is classified into two categories: 'Minor' and 'Major'. The Investigating Officer should bear in mind the following when defining misconduct as either major or minor:",

For example, plagiarism will not be condoned just because the work in question is not heavily weighted in terms of the overall mark for the unit, or the course itself is not a significantly weighted course within the programme. Level of study is not germane to the decision;\n3.3.2. The extent of the misconduct is a key factor: a piece of work which has been downloaded verbatim from the internet will inevitably be regarded as a prima facie case of major misconduct whereas the lack of proper citation in one or two articles or where it is incorrectly formatted might be seen as a minor case of misconduct;\n3.3.3. Consideration of the extent of the pre-meditated intention involved in the misconduct. Where the evidence suggests the student has been sophisticated in their use of unattributed material, e.g., deliberate minor editing of plagiarised text to give the\n\nimpression that it is their own work, what appears initially to be a quantitatively minor breach might instead be deemed major. Conversely, a large but single and un-edited example of non-attribute within an essay which is otherwise properly referenced might justify deeming an apparently major case as minor.\n\n3.3.4.1. Minor misconduct is where a small proportion of a piece of assessed work is found to be plagiarized.\n3.3.4.2. Misconduct is more likely to be considered 'minor' when a student is inexperienced and the misconduct relates mainly to the poor use of referencing protocols.\n3.3.4.3. Multiple instances (more than 02) of minor misconduct are likely to lead to a charge of 'major' misconduct.",

If this is not forthcoming, the Investigating Officer will not proceed with the case.\n\nDeliberate or severe cases of plagiarism may result in strict punitive actions from the Institute. The competent authority may appoint a faculty member, adept at managing conflicting situations, as the Convener of Academic Ethics Committee (AEC). This Convener will be tasked with raising awareness about plagiarism among students and staff by disseminating study material or sharing videos or organizing seminars or workshops. Additionally, they will be responsible for drafting policy documents for the Senate/Board's consideration as and when needed. The Convener may also co-opt additional members when necessary.\n\nIn the event of a reported academic ethics violation, the competent authority will form a three-member committee to investigate the complaint as follows:\n\nConvenor, AEC\nOne subject expert from the Department - Member\nOne expert from another Department - Member\n\nFollowing a comprehensive investigation, the AEC will propose suitable actions based on the severity and type of violation.",

The Exam Cell Coordinator will be responsible for ensuring that the Investigating Officer receives appropriate assistance in undertaking the initial determination in relation to reviewing the submitted assessment.\n5.1.3. Where the allegation is plagiarism, the examiner should mark the work taking the plagiarism into account. If a piece of work is plagiarised, in whole or in part, the mark should be reduced in proportion to the extent of the plagiarism identified. Non plagiarised sections should be marked as standard. Therefore, the final mark should reflect a combination of the extent of the plagiarised passages, and the quality of the non plagiarised work; it may or may not be a fail mark.\n5.1.4. The Investigating Officer may consult with course coordinators, examiners, and will determine whether or not a prima facie case for suspecting a student of misconduct has been presented.\n5.1.5. If a prima facie case has been presented, the Investigating Officer shall determine whether the alleged misconduct is either a minor or major case of misconduct.\n5.1.6. Once the Investigating Officer has made a determination that the case is either minor or major, the Exam Cell Coordinator will send a letter to the student to inform them that their work is under investigation, and what will happen next.\n\n5.2.1.

Prejudice or Bias: Students can appeal if they believe there is evidence showing prejudice or bias on the part of those who made the decision regarding their case. This could involve situations where the decision-makers appeared to favor one side unfairly, showed personal bias, or did not objectively assess the evidence. Evidence of bias could include discriminatory actions, conflicts of interest, or actions that suggest a predetermined outcome.\n\nOperationally, appeals for academic misconduct follow established procedures for handling all academic matters, ensuring fairness and transparency in the appeals process. Appeals typically involve a review by an independent body or panel (selected by the competent authority) to assess whether the grounds for appeal are valid and to reconsider the original decision if necessary.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*",
